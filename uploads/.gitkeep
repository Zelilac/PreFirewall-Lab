# Upload Directory

This directory stores uploaded files (intentionally insecure).

**WARNING**: In this vulnerable application:
- No file type validation
- No size restrictions
- Files are publicly accessible
- Potential webshell uploads

This demonstrates why firewalls/WAFs must inspect uploaded content.
