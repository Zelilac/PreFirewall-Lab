# PreFirewall Lab Sample Data Files

This directory contains sample data files for testing path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Files

- `sample.txt` - Sample text file for legitimate download
- `logs/` - Log files directory (create subdirectory)
- `config/` - Configuration files directory (create subdirectory)

## Note

These files are intentionally simple to demonstrate path traversal attacks.
Real applications would have more complex file structures.
